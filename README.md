Build instructions:



Computers have been a boon for creativity and imagination. Digital art has, for decades now, been a medium in its own right; and with the advent of NFTs, the future might be very bright indeed for digital artists. Today, we'll build an app that lets your friends and loved ones express their creative side.

Today, your challenge is to build one of the below:

## Frontend-only

Build an app that lets people express their creativity in a visual format. You can build ANY application you'd like. Whether it's a blank canvas that you can paint on, a photo-editing app, a shared white board -- as long as it fulfills one OR both of the following requirements:

- As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
- As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.

## Full-stack (Optional)

Broadly speaking: add a full-stack feature that makes sense for your application. Examples include:

- Shareable art
- Saveable files
- User profiles with galleries of work


## Personal Goals
- draw lines on canvas (Done!)
- clear canvas (Done!)
- drawing parameters (change pen size, pen color)
- stamp (fill clicked area with specified shape)
- shape parameters (change shape size, fill color, stroke color)
- fill area with color
- create landing page (Done!)
- style drawing page
- style landing page

## Stretch Goals
- saving images as .png
- extra stamp options (star, heart, other complex shapes)
- canvas layers
